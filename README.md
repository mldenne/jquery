Intro to jQuery & ajax

Let's adjust our Chirp API slightly and use jQuery and JavaScript to output a public timeline.

Deliverables

A site that uses your Chirp API to dynamically display a public timeline
A link to a GitHub repo or a GitHub Pages URL for said site
Requirements

Explorer Mode

Your Chirp API should now show a timeline of all posts if a request is made to the timeline endpoint with any authentication. Don't forget to deploy this adjustment to Heroku. And to update your documentation.
Your combination of HTML, JavaScript and CSS should use that new unauthenticated endpoint to display a list of chirps in a nicely formatted way (this is generally code for bootstrap).
You should display the user avatar, the body of the chirp, the username of the user who posted the chirp and the time and date the chirp was posted
Use jQuery to help make the above easier.

Adventure Mode

Deploy your site to GitHub pages
Format the timestamp nicely using moment.js
Use Handlebars as a template for your chirps
